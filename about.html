                                This is a Falcon Heavy (FH) rocket. I created this model in the program blender. The Falcon Heavy rocket is one of the biggest rockets ever manufactured. I managed to create this by using common blender tools like the scale tool the hotkey being 's', the merging and seperate tool, the shrink and fatten tool easily acessed by using the hotkey 'e' and using the different modes of Object mode and Edit mode. Also by swapping through the viewports including the render viewport, Texture and wireframe viewports all possesing different qualities allowing me to access these different qualities to use in different scenario's. By using the Edit mode it was easy to change the stock standard shapes into desired shapes which fit the model you had invisioned.

                                In making this 3d model and my website I encountered numerious issues. These include textures not exporting from blender to sketchfab to my website not being shown on my given repository on Github. But through taking cautions and being carefull when writing my HTML website there weren't to many issues seen in the HTML and CSS validators showing that my code was quite accurate and took less time when testing and debugging. The most time consuming issue I encountered was the textures not exporting to sketchfab. I eventually found the solution of just adding the specific logo's directly to the sketchfab model editor.
